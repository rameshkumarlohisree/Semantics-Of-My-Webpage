                        Indian classical dance, or Shastriya Nritya, is an umbrella term for different regionally-specific Indian classical
                        dance traditions, rooted in predominantly Hindu musical theatre performance,[1][2][3] the theory and practice of which
                        can be traced to the Sanskrit text Natya Shastra.[4][5][6] The number of Indian classical dance styles ranges from six
                        to eight to twelve, or more, depending on the source and scholar;[7][8] the main organisation for Indian arts
                        preservation, the Sangeet Natak Academy recognizes eight: Bharatanatyam, Kathak, Kuchipudi, Odissi, Kathakali, Sattriya,
                        Manipuri and Mohiniyattam.[9] Additionally, the Indian Ministry of Culture includes Chhau in its list, recognising nine
                        total styles.[10] Scholars such as Drid Williams add Chhau, Yakshagana and Bhagavata Mela to the list.[11][3] Each dance
                        tradition originates and comes from a different state and/or region of India; for example, Bharatanatyam is from Tamil
                        Nadu in the south of India, Odissi is from the east coast state of Odisha, and Manipuri is from the northeastern state
                        of Manipur. The music associated with these different dance performances consists many compositions in Hindi, Malayalam,
                        Meitei (Manipuri), Sanskrit, Tamil, Odia, Telugu, Assamese, and many other Indian-Subcontinent languages; they represent
                        a unity of core ideas and a diversity of styles, costumes, and expression.

                        Belly dance (Arabic: رقص شرقي, romanized: Raqs sharqi, lit. 'oriental dance') is a Middle Eastern dance[1][2][3][4][5]
                        that originated in Egypt,[6] which features movements of the hips and torso.[2] A Western-coined exonym, it is also
                        referred to as Middle Eastern dance or Arabic dance.[7][8][9] It has evolved to take many different forms depending on
                        the country and region, both in costume and dance style; with the styles and costumes of Egypt being the most recognized
                        worldwide due to Egyptian cinema.[10][11] Belly dancing in its various forms and styles is popular across the globe
                        where it is taught by a multitude of schools of dance.
